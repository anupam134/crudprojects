"# crudprojects" 
A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application is a type of software or system that allows users to perform basic operations on data. These operations are the fundamental actions performed on persistent storage like databases.

CRUD Information:
Create: Add new data to the system (e.g., adding a new user or product).
Read: Retrieve or view the existing data from the system (e.g., viewing a list of users or a single user's details).
Update: Modify or update existing data in the system (e.g., changing a user's details).
Delete: Remove data from the system (e.g., deleting a user or product).
